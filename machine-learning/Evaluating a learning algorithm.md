# Evaluating a learning algorithm
ex. we can use 70% training examples for training and 30% for testing

## Evaluating Linear Regression, Logistic Regression using the squared error function
1. construct model using training data
2. use the $\theta$ parameters learned, run the cost function $J(\theta)$ on the test set

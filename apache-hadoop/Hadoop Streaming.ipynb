    "# Hadoop Streaming\n",
    "Hadoop streaming allows you to create and run Map/Reduce jobs with any executable or script as the mapper and/or the reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar \\\n",
    "    -input myInputDirs \\\n",
    "    -output myOutputDir \\\n",
    "    -mapper /bin/cat \\\n",
    "    -reducer /bin/wc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "When an executable is specified for mappers, each mapper task will launch the executable as a separate process when the mapper is initialized. As the mapper task runs, it converts its inputs into lines and feed the lines to the stdin of the process. In the meantime, the mapper collects the line oriented outputs from the stdout of the process and converts each line into a key/value pair, which is collected as the output of the mapper. By default, the prefix of a line up to the first tab character is the key and the rest of the line (excluding the tab character) will be the value. If there is no tab character in the line, then entire line is considered as key and the value is null. However, this can be customized, as discussed later.\n",

    "When an executable is specified for reducers, each reducer task will launch the executable as a separate process then the reducer is initialized. As the reducer task runs, it converts its input key/values pairs into lines and feeds the lines to the stdin of the process. In the meantime, the reducer collects the line oriented outputs from the stdout of the process, converts each line into a key/value pair, which is collected as the output of the reducer. By default, the prefix of a line up to the first tab character is the key and the rest of the line (excluding the tab character) is the value. However, this can be customized, as discussed later."

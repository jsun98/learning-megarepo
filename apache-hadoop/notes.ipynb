    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "- Hadoop is a distributed file system\n",
    "- Efficient, automatic distribution of data and work across machines\n",
    "- High throughput access to information\n",
    "- Data is conceptually record-oriented in the Hadoop programming framework. The Hadoop framework then schedules these processes in proximity to the location of data/records using knowledge from the distributed file system. This strategy of moving computation to the data, instead of moving the data to the computation allows Hadoop to achieve high data locality which in turn results in high performance.\n",

    "## Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) \n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "**block**: Files may be broken into several blocks, default block size is 64MB\n",
    "**NameNode**: The NameNode stores all the metadata for the file system.\n",
    "**DataNode**: A machine in a cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "![](https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2050/3529146393_5c2e2c8065_o.png)\n",
    "- HDFS expects to store very large files\n",
    "- Large block size reduces amount of metadata stored\n",
    "- HDFS files are **not visible** to the Linux operating system hosting Hadoop\n",
    "- data is replicated across several machines, system still works even if 1 or serveral machines fail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- HDFS is designed to store a very large amount of information (terabytes or petabytes). This requires spreading the data across a large number of machines. It also supports much larger file sizes than NFS.\n",
    "- HDFS should store data reliably. If individual machines in the cluster malfunction, data should still be available.\n",
    "- HDFS should provide fast, scalable access to this information. It should be possible to serve a larger number of clients by simply adding more machines to the cluster.\n",
    "- HDFS should integrate well with Hadoop MapReduce, allowing data to be read and computed upon locally when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Applications that use HDFS are assumed to perform long sequential streaming reads from files. HDFS is optimized to provide streaming read performance; this comes at the expense of random seek times to arbitrary positions in files.\n",
    "- Data will be written to the HDFS once and then read several times; updates to files after they have already been closed are not supported. (An extension to Hadoop will provide support for appending new data to the ends of files; it is scheduled to be included in Hadoop 0.19 but is not available yet.)\n",
    "- Due to the large size of files, and the sequential nature of reads, the system does not provide a mechanism for local caching of data. The overhead of caching is great enough that data should simply be re-read from HDFS source.\n",
    "- Individual machines are assumed to fail on a frequent basis, both permanently and intermittently. The cluster must be able to withstand the complete failure of several machines, possibly many happening at the same time (e.g., if a rack fails all together). While performance may degrade proportional to the number of machines lost, the system as a whole should not become overly slow, nor should information be lost. Data replication strategies combat this problem.\n",

    "``InputFormat``: How these input files are split up and read is defined by the InputFormat. An InputFormat is a class that provides the following functionality:\n",

    "- The ``Reporter`` object provides information about the current task; its getInputSplit() method will return an object describing the current InputSplit. It also allows the map task to provide additional information about its progress to the rest of the system. The setStatus() method allows you to emit a status message back to the user. The incrCounter() method allows you to increment shared performance counters. You may define as many arbitrary counters as you wish. Each mapper can increment the counters, and the JobTracker will collect the increments made by the different processes and aggregate them for later retrieval when the job ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "``Partition & Shuffle``: This process of moving map outputs to the reducers is known as ``shuffling``. A different subset of the intermediate key space is assigned to each reduce node; these subsets (known as ``partitions``) are the inputs to the reduce tasks. Each map task may emit ``(key, value)`` pairs to any partition; **all values for the same key are always reduced together regardless of which mapper is its origin**. Therefore, the map nodes must all agree on where to send the different pieces of the intermediate data. The ``Partitioner`` class determines which partition a given (key, value) pair will go to. The default partitioner computes a hash value for the key and assigns the partition based on this result. \n",
    "\n",
    "``Reduce``: A Reducer instance is created for each reduce task. This is an instance of user-provided code that performs the second important phase of job-specific work. For each key in the partition assigned to a ``Reducer``, the ``Reducer``'s ``reduce()`` method is called once. This receives a key as well as an iterator over all the values associated with the key. The values associated with a key are returned by the iterator in an undefined order. The Reducer also receives as parameters ``OutputCollector`` and ``Reporter`` objects; they are used in the same manner as in the ``map()`` method.\n",

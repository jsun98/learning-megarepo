    "## What is Hadoop\n",
    "A reliable, scalable platform for storage and analysis that is affordable and runs on commodity hardware. Hadoop consists of the `Hadoop Distributed File System` (HDFS) and `MapReduce`, a programming model used for batch processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hadoop vs RDBMS\n",
    "Hadoop\n",
    "    - batch processing the entire dataset\n",
    "    - disk transfer rate (streaming data)\n",
    "    - petabytes\n",
    "    - write once, read many times\n",
    "    - schema-on-read\n",
    "    - scales linearly\n",
    "    - non-structured and semi-strcutured data\n",
    "    - data locality\n",
    "\n",
    "RDBMS\n",
    "    - point queries and updates on an indexed, relatively small dataset\n",
    "    - disk seek (moving the read head)\n",
    "    - gigabytes\n",
    "    - read and write many times\n",
    "    - schema-on-write\n",
    "    - scales nonlinearly \n",
    "    - structured data\n",

    "## History and Numbers\n",
    "- Created by Doug Cutting\n",
    "- Hadoop had its origins in Apache Nutch, an open source web search engine\n",
    "- In 2005, the Nutch Distributed Filesystem (NDFS) was developed using MapReduce and ideas from the Google File System\n",
    "- In Febuary 2006, Hadoop became an independent project \n",
    "- In 2006, Doug Cutting joined Yahoo!\n",
    "- In 2008, Hadoop was put into production at Yahoo! Search\n",
    "- In 2008, Hadoop become the fastest system to sort an entire terabyte of data. Running on a 910-node cluster, Hadoop sorted 1 terabyte in 209 seconds\n",
    "- In 2009, a team at Yahoo! had used Hadoop to sort 1 terabyte in 62 seconds"
